                With the new release of Google Earth learning about our planet has become a lot more interesting and fun too. The program is a free web-based application that creates a virtual Earth from satellite pictures of every part of the globe. Users can zoom in on city blocks, rainforests or even motorways. The first version of Google Earth was released in 2005. In the past years, it has been downloaded about 500 million times. 
                <br><br> In earlier versions of the software, users were only able to view the surface of our planet. Water was seen upon as only a dull blue surface. Google Earth 5.0 changes that.
                <br><br> <img src="/image/The-New-Google-Earth.png">
                <br><br> During two years of hard work, Google’s developers have improved the program. Now it is possible to explore the oceans and the sky. It even includes a globe of the planet Mars. The company has also added other content like videos, photos and audio clips.
                <br><br> The content covers a wide range of topics. If you click on Hawaii, for example, you cannot only see satellite images of the islands but also learn about humpback whales. Clicking on a part of the Atlantic Ocean will bring forth images and videos of sunken ships like the Titanic.
                <br><br> With this content, Google wants to show us how important it is to understand the world’s ocean and how we are connected with them.
                <br><br> Google again provides advanced features that can be used in Google Earth.
                <br><br> Voyager or interactive tour guide service is a new feature in Google Earth. This feature allows you to know a variety of information about a place clearly. The description of a place is clearly written.
                <br><br> I'm Feeling Lucky is another new feature of Google Earth. By pressing a button "I'm Feeling Lucky," you will be directed to unique places you may not have known. There are also various explanations, such as facts, history, and other place recommendations.
                <br><br> Lastly, the 3D Maps feature. Google makes everything look real. This new feature of Google Earth allows you to see a place in 3D. Although only a few famous places can be seen in 3D, this is certainly enough to help you find out what buildings are there.
